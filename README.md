Android video player based on [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer)

It uses ExoPlayer's ``extension-ffmpeg`` with [all its audio formats](https://exoplayer.dev/supported-formats.html#ffmpeg-extension) enabled (it can handle even special formats like AC3, EAC3, DTS, DTS HD, TrueHD etc.).

It properly syncs audio with video track when using Bluetooth earphones/speaker. (I was not able to find any other nice ExoPlayer based video player so I created this one.)

## Supported formats

 * **Audio**: Vorbis, Opus, FLAC, ALAC, PCM/WAVE (풮-law, A-law), MP1, MP2, MP3, AMR (NB, WB), AAC (LC, ELD, HE; xHE on Android 9+), AC-3, E-AC-3, DTS, DTS-HD, TrueHD
 * **Video**: H.263, H.264 AVC (Baseline Profile; Main Profile on Android 6+), H.265 HEVC, MPEG-4 SP, VP8, VP9, AV1
 * **Containers**: MP4, MOV, WebM, MKV, Ogg, MPEG-TS, MPEG-PS, FLV
 * **Subtitles**: SRT, SSA, ASS, TTML, VTT

HDR (HDR10+ and Dolby Vision) video playback on compatible/supported hardware.

## Features

 * Audio/subtitle track selection
 * Playback speed control
 * Horizontal swipe and double tap to quickly seek
 * Vertical swipe to change brightness (left) / volume (right)
 * Pinch to zoom (Android 7+)
 * PiP (Picture in Picture) on Android 8+ (resizable on Android 11+)
 * Resize (fit/crop)
 * Volume boost
 * No ads, tracking or even the Internet permission (no storage permission either)

To load external (non-embedded) subtitles, long press the file open action in the bottom bar. The first time you do that, you will be offered to select root video folder to enable automatic loading of external subtitles.

**`WRITE_SETTINGS` ("Modify system settings") permission**: When the system file chooser is opened, it will always use current system orientation, even if the Player app sets its own. Granting this permission via adb (`adb shell pm grant com.brouken.player android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS`) or App info screen will allow this app to temporarily enable Auto-rotate to at least partially mitigate [this imperfection](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/141968218).

## FAQ

### What to do if Bluetooth audio is not in sync with video?

Just pause and resume playback once again.

### How do I change subtitle font, size or color?

If you enable [Caption preferences](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006554) on your device, you will be able to override the default subtitle style of the Player and fully customize subtitle style.

### Are there any media formats it CANNOT play?

Unfortunately, upstream ExoPlayer doesn't handle some older formats like [AVI container](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2092), WMV or [Theora](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4970).

Just Player focuses on playing videos so audio only playback isn't officialy supported. 

### Can I play videos that are not stored on the device?

#### Videos in cloud storages - YES

Official cloud storage clients (like [Dropbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dropbox.android) or [Google Drive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs)) usually implement all the technical requirements so storage can be browsed when opening video in Just Player.

#### Video streams on the Internet - Yes (since v0.16-online)

Basic support for playing streaming videos is in the `-online` version, available only in [releases on Github](https://github.com/moneytoo/Player/releases/latest) (F-Droid and Google Play are staying on the `-offline` build).

#### Videos in network storages (Samba, WebDAV, SCP etc.) - YES (since v0.16-online)

You can open videos on network storages using file managers such as [Solid Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2), [Total Commander](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ghisler.android.TotalCommander) or [Ghost Commander](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ghostsq.commander).

### Android TV support?

Notes on partial, [experimental support](https://github.com/moneytoo/Player/issues/26#issuecomment-778677387).

## Other open source Android video players

Here's a comparison table presenting all available and significant open source video players for Android I was able to find. Just Player is something like 80% feature complete. It will probably never have dozens of options or some rich media library UI. It will never truly compete with feature rich VLC. It just attempts to provide functional feature set and motive others to create greater players based on amazing ExoPlayer.
